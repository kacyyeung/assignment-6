This is the final version of my portfolio/personal website.

It is in the style of a 2d pixel game using WASD controls to walk around.
The four pages are:
* Start/Welcome area
* About area
* Skills area
* Contacts area

There are 3 links embeded into the icons in the Contacts area.
The user is followed by the camera view and can walk around the platform but is restricted by it's borders.
